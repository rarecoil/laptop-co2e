# Laptop carbon footprints

This is a list of carbon footprints compiled from various sources for common laptops. I have compiled these from various sources in case you need a new laptop. If you would like to add more to this list, please issue a pull request.

**kg CO2e** (kg. CO2 equivalent) is the total expected lifetime (4-year) carbon footprint of the device.

**kg CO2e w/o use** is the total footprint of the device to make it and send it to you. If your electricity sources are carbon-neutral, this number is the one that matters.

### Laptop footprints, in perspective

Aside from the outlier X270, the worst laptop on this list is the Thinkpad P52 at 693 kg CO2e over a four-year lifespan. [A single cheeseburger has a carbon footprint of about 4.35 kg CO2e](http://www.openthefuture.com/cheeseburger_CF.html). Buying a P52 is the same cost as eating 159 cheeseburgers over the course of that four years - or eating a single cheeseburger every 1.3 weeks. There is a reason why environmentalists push vehicle emissions first and animal agriculture second - the cost of eating _red meat_ is substantially worse than even other meat options. It is good to minimise carbon emissions wherever you can, but remember that driving less and avoiding beef consumption will drastically outweigh your laptop purchasing choices in terms of carbon footprint.

Note that organisations do play with these numbers a bit, because the science to calculate these is relatively inexact. Lenovo reports the 95th percentile worst-case as their footprints in the data sheet; some other organizations will quote the median +/- a specific value. Use this as a guide, and read the attached documents for more information.


## tl;dr

Microsoft's Surface series usually beats Apple. If you can use Windows 10 Pro, the Surface series has the lowest overall manufacturing footprint in the CSR reports. Apple is a close second, with Lenovo coming in last place. Note that the Microsoft and Apple laptops are not repairable. Let's all be happy that the Thinkpad X270 is no longer in production - each one cost the world 0.8 MT CO2e.

Chromebooks may be an option for you when using [Crostini](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/containers_and_vms.md), but make sure that the device you buy supports the Linux container functionality before purchasing. Support is getting better as of 2019 but some devices (e.g. Skylake-based devices) still do not have Crostini support at the time of this writing.

## Apple

Macs have insanely low carbon footprints compared to respective Lenovo models. The most carbon-friendly MacBook **at manufacture** is the new MacBook Air, at 176kg CO2e with use and 165.44 without. However, the new Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Pro 13" has a better after-use calculation at 149.85 according to Apple's documentation.

Note the four-year lifespan of these. **These Apple products are virtually nonrepairable**, so the lifetime of them will likely be much less than a Thinkpad or Latitude. Keep that in mind - most of the footprint is up front with the laptop's manufacture. If you are keeping it for a long time, you're probably better off with the Thinkpad.

As a general guide, Apple posts its environmental updates and content on a section of their website here for [ENVIRONMENTAL](https://www.apple.com/environment/) data.  As of 2024 03 06, there is an updated [2023 environmental impact report](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2023.pdf) that is quite thourough. If for some reason the content in this file is stale, please do go to the [ENVIRONMENTAL](https://www.apple.com/environment/) site to look for updated content.

\* Apple does not change the "use" proportion for any 2020 MacBook Pro, so the M1 uses the same amount of energy as the Intel variants.

## Chromebooks

Chromebook product carbon footprints vary widely. In order to normalise the numbers, the 95th percentile number is quoted where appropriate in this table (as Lenovo and HP both report). Note that HP's data is generally pretty bad; the 95th percentile is far off from their expected range so they are likely over-reported in this table.

I cannot locate Acer's carbon footprint calculations; they talk about environmental responsibility in a PR-like page and the data for the old Chromebook C740 is included, so I have added it to this list.

## Dell

Dell does not produce as many carbon footprint sheets, but does for
some specific models.

The Latitude 7280/7390 has the best footprint, at 187.81 without use and
222 with use included. This may be the best all-around deal, because the
Latitude series is relatively repairable, reliable being business-class,
and gets very close to Apple's numbers.

## Lenovo Thinkpad

Without use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the Thinkpad A285, with 225.28 kg CO2e. If you want Intel (or Thunderbolt 3), your choice is the Thinkpad X390, with 246.5 kg CO2e. However, the A285's architecture is old and it is power hungry.

With use included, the best Thinkpad in this list is the X395, with 286 kg CO2e (and the X280 following up with 334.)

## Microsoft

My girlfriend recently asked me what the carbon footprint of the Surface devices is, and I did not know. Microsoft makes this easy and [provides eco profiles for download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55974). This is a list of all Surface hardware included in that download as of 18 November 2021.

It is important to note that the Surface Pro/Go numbers are _just for the device_. The keyboard is considered an accessory and there is an associated manufacturing footprint that is not accounted for there. Microsoft's eco profiles even list the exact specs of the machines they are using for calculations. Note that while the Surface Go is definitely the lowest in this list, it's not really a developer-friendly laptop.

The same nonrepairability warning that goes into the Apple products holds true for the Surface line, as well.
